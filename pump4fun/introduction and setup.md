## Introduction

Pump.fun revolutionized the meme token space by creating a platform where anyone can easily create and trade tokens with automated market maker functionality. This approach democratizes token creation by eliminating complex setup processes and providing instant liquidity for trading.

In this comprehensive guide, we'll build a pump.fun-inspired token launchpad using the Move programming language on the Movement blockchain. Our platform will enable users to create fungible asset tokens with metadata, trade them through an automated market maker (AMM) system, and track transaction history.

## What You'll Build

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have created:

- **Token Creation System**: A smart contract that allows users to create fungible asset tokens with custom metadata including name, symbol, description, and social media links
- **Automated Market Maker (AMM)**: A constant product formula-based trading system with 0.3% swap fees for token-MOVE pairs
- **Liquidity Pool Management**: Automatic liquidity pool creation with initial token and MOVE reserves
- **Token Distribution**: Fair token distribution where creators receive 5% of supply and 95% goes to the liquidity pool
- **Transaction History**: Complete tracking of buy/sell transactions with timestamps and USD value estimates
- **IPFS Integration**: Token metadata and image storage using Pinata for decentralized asset hosting
- **Price Discovery**: Real-time price calculation based on pool reserves and trading activity
- **Administrative Controls**: Fee management and metadata update capabilities

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the implementation, ensure you have the following prerequisites set up:

- **[Movement CLI](https://developer.movementnetwork.xyz/learning-paths/basic-concepts/01-install-movement-cli)**: Essential for interacting with the Movement blockchain
- **[Aptos CLI](https://aptos.dev/cli-tools/aptos-cli-tool/install-aptos-cli)**: Required for certain operations compatible with Movement
- **[Scaffold-Move](https://github.com/arjanjohan/scaffold-move)**: A development framework that streamlines building Move applications
- **[Aptos SDK](https://aptos.dev/en/build/sdks/ts-sdk)**: Set up the Aptos SDK for interacting with the Movement testnet and managing blockchain operations
- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)**: Required for running Next.js and related frontend dependencies (version 18 or later recommended)
- **[Pinata Account](https://pinata.cloud/)**: For IPFS storage of token images and metadata
- An **IDE**: Use an integrated development environment like **[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)** or **[IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)** for writing and debugging code
- **Basic familiarity with [Move](https://developer.movementnetwork.xyz/learning-paths/basic-concepts)**: A foundational understanding of the Move programming language
- **Understanding of [Bonding Curves](https://blog.relevant.community/bonding-curves-in-depth-intuition-parametrization-d3905a681e0a)**: Basic knowledge of automated market maker mechanics
- **Familiarity with [Scaffold-Move Hooks](https://scaffold-move-docs.vercel.app/hooks/)**: Understanding how to use the custom hooks provided by Scaffold-Move for blockchain interactions

The complete code for this guide is available on GitHub [here](https://github.com/dumbdevss/pump-fun).

## TL;DR

- Set up a Scaffold-Move project for streamlined Move development on the Movement testnet
- Write Move modules for token creation, bonding curve trading, and liquidity management
- Integrate Pinata for decentralized token image and metadata storage
- Develop a responsive Next.js interface mimicking pump.fun's user experience
- Deploy the complete pump.fun clone to the Movement testnet with comprehensive testing

## Setting up Development Environment

To begin building our pump.fun clone, we'll set up an isolated and efficient development environment using a pre-bootstrapped repository. Follow these steps to get started:

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the tutorial repository, which has been bootstrapped with `scaffold-move` for Movement development:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dumbdevss/pump-fun
cd pump-fun
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the necessary project dependencies using Yarn:

```bash
yarn install
```

### 3. Generate a Deployment Account

Create a local account for interacting with the Movement testnet:

```bash
yarn account
```

After initialization, note the generated account address and update the `Move.toml` file:

```toml
[addresses]
pump_fun = "<your_generated_account_address>"
```

> **Note**: If you encounter an error, navigate to the `packages/move` directory and use `movement init` or `aptos init`, depending on the CLI installed.

```bash
movement init --network custom --rest-url https://testnet.bardock.movementnetwork.xyz/v1 --faucet-url https://faucet.testnet.bardock.movementnetwork.xyz/
```

### 4. Set up Pinata Integration

Create a Pinata account and obtain your API credentials:

1. Sign up at [Pinata.cloud](https://pinata.cloud/)
2. Navigate to API Keys in your dashboard
3. Create a new API key with the following permissions:
   - `pinFileToIPFS`
   - `pinJSONToIPFS`
   - `userPinnedDataTotal`

Add your Pinata credentials to your environment variables:

```bash
# In your .env.local file
NEXT_PUBLIC_PINATA_JWT=your_pinata_jwt_token
NEXT_PUBLIC_PINATA_GATEWAY=your_pinata_gateway_url
```

## Understanding the Project Structure

The project is structured to clearly separate smart contract logic, frontend components, and utility functions:

### Smart Contract Layer (`packages/move`)

- **`sources/`**: Contains the core Move module
  - **`pump_for_fun.move`**: Main contract handling token creation, AMM trading, liquidity pools, and transaction history

### Frontend Layer (`packages/nextjs`)

- **`components/`**: Reusable React components used throughout the application.
- **`app/`**: Next.js app router pages
- **`hooks/`**: Custom React hooks for blockchain interactions
- **`utils/`**: Helper functions and utilities

## Next Steps: Developing the Smart Contract

Now that we've set up our development environment and understood the project structure, let's move on to developing the core smart contract for our NFT Ticketing system. In the following section, we'll write the Move code that will power our decentralized ticketing platform
