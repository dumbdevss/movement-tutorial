## Introduction

Token vesting is a crucial mechanism in blockchain ecosystems that enables controlled and scheduled token distribution over time. This system is particularly valuable for startups, DAOs, and projects that need to distribute tokens to team members, investors, or community members while preventing immediate sell-offs and ensuring long-term commitment.

In this guide, we'll walk you through building a comprehensive token vesting decentralized application (dApp) using the Move programming language on the Movement testnet. This vesting contract will allow project owners to create customizable vesting streams with cliff periods, manage multiple beneficiaries simultaneously, and provide transparent tracking of vested and claimed tokens.

## Key Features

Our vesting system includes the following powerful features:

- **Flexible Vesting Schedules**: Create custom vesting periods with linear token release
- **Cliff Periods**: Implement cliff mechanisms to prevent early token access
- **Multi-Beneficiary Support**: Create multiple vesting streams in a single transaction
- **Real-time Tracking**: Monitor vested amounts and claiming history
- **Secure Access Control**: Owner-only functions for stream creation and fund management
- **Event Logging**: Comprehensive event emission for transparency and monitoring
- **Resource Account Architecture**: Secure fund management through Aptos resource accounts

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the implementation, ensure you have the following prerequisites set up:

- **[Movement CLI](https://developer.movementnetwork.xyz/learning-paths/basic-concepts/01-install-movement-cli)**: Essential for interacting with the Movement blockchain
- **[Aptos CLI](https://aptos.dev/cli-tools/aptos-cli-tool/install-aptos-cli)**: Required for certain operations compatible with Movement
- **[Scaffold-Move](https://github.com/arjanjohan/scaffold-move)**: Development framework that streamlines building Move applications
- **[Aptos SDK](https://aptos.dev/en/build/sdks/ts-sdk)**: For interacting with the Movement testnet and managing blockchain operations
- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)**: Required for running Next.js and related frontend dependencies (version 16 or later recommended)
- An **IDE**: Use VS Code or IntelliJ IDEA for writing and debugging code
- **Basic familiarity with [Move](https://developer.movementnetwork.xyz/learning-paths/basic-concepts)**: A foundational understanding of the Move programming language
- **Understanding of Token Economics**: Basic knowledge of vesting mechanisms and tokenomics

## Use Cases

This vesting system is ideal for various scenarios:

- **Team Token Distribution**: Distribute tokens to team members with long-term vesting schedules
- **Investor Relations**: Manage investor token allocations with appropriate cliff periods
- **Community Incentives**: Create vesting programs for community contributors and early adopters
- **DAO Treasury Management**: Implement structured token releases for DAO operations
- **Partnership Agreements**: Manage token distributions for strategic partnerships

## TL;DR

- Set up a Move development environment for building on the Movement testnet
- Implement a comprehensive vesting contract with cliff periods and multi-beneficiary support
- Deploy and test the vesting system with built-in test cases
- Create a user-friendly interface for managing vesting streams and token claims
- Understand resource account architecture for secure fund management

## Architecture Overview

Our vesting system uses a resource account architecture that provides several security and operational benefits:

- **Resource Account**: A separate account that holds all vested tokens, controlled by the main contract
- **Stream Management**: Individual vesting streams with unique identifiers and customizable parameters
- **Access Control**: Owner-only functions for critical operations like stream creation and fund deposits
- **Event System**: Comprehensive logging for all vesting operations and claims

## Setting up Development Environment

To begin building our token vesting system, we'll set up an efficient development environment:

1. **Initialize Movement Project**
   Create a new Movement project for our vesting contract:

   ```bash
   movement init vesting-contract --network testnet
   cd vesting-contract
   ```

2. **Configure Move.toml**
   Update your `Move.toml` file with the necessary dependencies:

   ```toml
   [package]
   name = "vesting-contract"
   version = "1.0.0"
   authors = ["Your Name <your.email@example.com>"]

   [addresses]
   blockchain = "_" # Will be replaced with your account address

   [dependencies]
   AptosFramework = { git = "https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core.git", subdir = "aptos-move/framework/aptos-framework", rev = "mainnet" }
   ```

3. **Generate Deployment Account**
   Create and fund an account for deployment:

   ```bash
   movement account create --account-name main
   movement account fund-with-faucet --account-name main
   ```

4. **Update Configuration**
   Replace the placeholder address in `Move.toml` with your generated account address.

## Understanding the Contract Structure

Our vesting contract consists of several key components:

- **VestingStream**: Individual vesting configurations with beneficiary details, amounts, and timing
- **VestingContract**: Main contract resource that manages all streams and permissions
- **State**: Resource account management and event handling
- **Access Control**: Owner-only functions for critical operations
- **View Functions**: Public functions for querying vesting information

## Next Steps: Implementing the Smart Contract

With our development environment configured, we'll next dive into the implementation details of our vesting contract. In the following sections, we'll cover:

- **Core Contract Logic**: Implementing stream creation, token claiming, and access control
- **Testing Framework**: Comprehensive test cases to ensure contract security and functionality
- **Deployment Process**: Steps to deploy your vesting contract to the Movement testnet
- **Frontend Integration**: Building a user interface for interacting with the vesting system

This guide will provide you with a production-ready token vesting system that can be customized for your specific project needs while maintaining the highest security standards.
