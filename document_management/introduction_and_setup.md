## Introduction

Blockchain-based document management offers revolutionary advantages over traditional systems, providing enhanced security, immutability, and verifiable ownership.

In this guide, we'll walk you through building a document management decentralized application (dApp) using the Move programming language on the Movement testnet. This dApp will allow users to securely store document metadata on-chain, control access permissions, and maintain a verifiable history of document interactions.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the implementation, ensure you have the following prerequisites set up:

- **[Movement CLI](https://developer.movementnetwork.xyz/learning-paths/basic-concepts/01-install-movement-cli)**: Essential for interacting with the Movement blockchain
- **[Aptos CLI](https://aptos.dev/cli-tools/aptos-cli-tool/install-aptos-cli)**: Required for certain operations compatible with Movement
- **[Scaffold-Move](https://github.com/arjanjohan/scaffold-move)**: Development framework that streamlines building Move applications
- **[Aptos SDK](https://aptos.dev/en/build/sdks/ts-sdk)**: For interacting with the Movement testnet and managing blockchain operations
- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)**: Required for running Next.js and related frontend dependencies (version 16 or later recommended)
- **[IPFS/Pinata](https://www.pinata.cloud/)**: For decentralized storage of document content
- An **IDE**: Use VS Code or IntelliJ IDEA for writing and debugging code
- **Basic familiarity with [Move](https://developer.movementnetwork.xyz/learning-paths/basic-concepts)**: A foundational understanding of the Move programming language
- **Familiarity with [Scaffold-Move Hooks](https://scaffold-move-docs.vercel.app/hooks/)**: Understanding how to use the custom hooks for blockchain interactions

The complete code for this guide is available on GitHub [here](https://github.com/dumbdevss/document-management).

## TL;DR

- Set up a Scaffold-Move project for streamlined Move development on the Movement testnet
- Write a Move module to create and manage document storage with customizable access control
- Develop a responsive Next.js dashboard for users to upload, access, and share documents
- Deploy the document management dApp to the Movement testnet with comprehensive test cases

## Setting up Development Environment

To begin building our document management dApp, we'll set up an efficient development environment using a pre-bootstrapped repository:

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Clone the tutorial repository, which has been bootstrapped with `scaffold-move` for Movement development:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dumbdevss/document-management
   cd document-management
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Install the necessary project dependencies:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Generate a Deployment Account**
   Create a local account for interacting with the Movement testnet:

   ```bash
   yarn account
   ```

   After initialization, note the generated account address and update the `Move.toml` file:

   ```toml
   [addresses]
   document_management = "<your_generated_account_address>"
   ```

   > **Note**: If you encounter an error, navigate to the `packages/move` directory and use:

   ```bash
   movement init --network custom --rest-url https://testnet.bardock.movementnetwork.xyz/v1 --faucet-url https://faucet.testnet.bardock.movementnetwork.xyz/
   ```

## Understanding the Project Structure

The project is structured to clearly separate smart contract logic from user interface components:

- **`packages/move`**: Contains the Move smart contracts
  - **`sources`**: Core Move modules defining the logic for document management

- **`/frontend`**: Next.js application providing the user interface
  - **`/components`**: Reusable React components
  - **`/app`**: Application routes and pages
  - **`/hooks/scaffold-move`**: Custom React hooks for blockchain interaction
  - **`/utils`**: Helper functions and utilities

This separation of concerns promotes a maintainable and scalable codebase.

## Next Steps: Developing the Smart Contract

With our development environment set up and project structure understood, we'll next develop the core smart contract for our document management system. In the following section, we'll write the Move code that will power our decentralized document platform, implementing features such as:

- Document metadata storage
- Access control and permissions
- Version history tracking
- Secure sharing capabilities
